										<p>
											Prevention and treatment of opioid epidemic should consider co-use of other drugs. From a prevention perspective, understanding the use of multiple drugs highlights distinct pathways to opioid addiction, such as transition from prescription opiates to heroin and then to other drugs, or from recreational use of multiple lighter drugs to heroin and prescription opiates. From the treatment perspective, addressing polydrug use uncovers a bigger challenge than the treatment of just opioid dependence.
										</p>
										<p>
											We analyzed data from an ethnographic survey of 200 heroin users from Cleveland area in Ohio. We assessed the use of and attitudes to seven drugs: alcohol, marijuana, methamphetamine, heroin, crack cocaine, powder cocaine, and prescription pills. We applied cluster analysis techniques to estimate patterns of use. Regression analysis was used to identify the relationships between the attitudes and frequency of use of the drugs.
										</p>
										<p>
											We identified 5 clusters based on the frequency of drug use. Cluster 1 used heroin daily and almost exclusively, only occasionally using other drugs. Cluster 2 used heroin and crack cocaine daily. Cluster 3 used heroin concomitantly with alcohol, but also crack and pills Cluster 4 included daily heroin and marijuana users. Cluster 5 included part-time drug users. Frequency of drug use was most strongly associated with liking the drug and being anxious about when the user could obtain the drug.
										</p>
										<p>
											Our study identified 5 distinct types of polydrug use among heroin users in Cleveland which underscores variability between patterns of polydrug use. Polydrug use patterns are linked to attitudes toward each of the drugs, especially liking and being anxious when the user cannot obtain the drug. High drug availability and low cost facilitate transitions. Understanding polydrug use clusters among heroin users is important to addressing larger epidemic from both: prevention and treatment perspective.
