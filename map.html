							        '<p> I got my BA in Applied Mathematics & Sociology from Yale University in New Haven, CT. After four wonderful years as a member of Pierson College, I graduated in May 2017. </p>'+
							        '<p>While at Yale, I did many new things, such as competing in intercollegiate gymnastics, being a tap dancer, learning traditional letter press techniques, operating a spotlight for a dramatic production, designing the lighting for various dance shows, soliciting feedback on the local board of alders’ legislative agenda by going door-to-door, and writing two senior theses on very different topics. </p>'+
							        '<p>Being at Yale was very different than living in Elmhurst and I learned a lot about race (Elmhurst is ~90% white), feminism, and urban studies. And I learned how to code in a language other than Java, so that was good, too. </p>'+

							        '<p> Cambridge is a great place to live – there’s a never ending stream of things to do and places to visit, but still small enough that you can carve out a piece and call it your own. All of the universities give you guest speakers, conferences, and performances. I love the MBTA, despite all of the complaints that are inevitable of any public transit system. There are a surprisingly high number of neighborhoods to visit, which are easy to get to since the Boston area is mind-boggling small. One time, I WALKED from my office to an NBA stadium in 10 minutes. A single bus line, that’s two miles end-to-end, gets me to my office, my doctor’s office, the public library, a post office, and a painting class. </p>'+

							        '<p> I was born & raised in a western Chicago suburb called Elmhurst. I had a great time in school, especially with my high school math program. I spent most free afternoons in York High School’s ‘Math Lab,’ either working on my own homework or helping other people with theirs. To this day, whenever I’m in Elmhurst during the school year, I stop by the math department and say hello. </p>'+
							        '<p>I went a bit overboard with joining clubs – basically every morning (except Monday) & afternoon (except Friday), I went to a club meeting. At one point in time (or for a few years), I helped run Math Team, Scholastic Bowl, Science Olympiad, PRIDE (the anti-drug club with a misleading name), & International Club. Some days I would get to school before the sunrise & leave after the sunset – but I was usually busy doing things I really enjoyed. </p>'+
							        '<p>I also took two foreign languages concurrently (Spanish & Chinese). One year, they were back-to-back class periods. I would often use words from one language in another, which you wouldn’t think would happen with two languages as different as Spanish & Chinese. I spoke both frequently during my gap year, so thanks York! </p>'+
							        '<p>Some of my other hobbies during this time in my life include roller-blading (until I knocked out my teeth), working at the mall (and spending my entire paycheck at the mall), taking dance classes, and taking photos.</p>'+

Because of medical issues at the beginning of the trip, I spent most of my time in Kunming while the rest of the group spent the first month in the western mountains. While I was in Kunming, most of my days consisted of a language class, a cooking or calligraphy class, and lots of meandering around the lake in the center of the city. Some of my favorite parts of my time there were street food for breakfast, reading in the park, eating my host mother’s food, and speaking Chinese.</p>'+

							        '<p>Hands down, this was best summer of my life. I had an incredible time in Grado. The schedule could not have been better: three hours of class in the morning, lunch (and you know it was delicious), homework on the beach, and then a delicious dinner while practicing Italian with my wonderful & supportive host family. </p>'+
							        '<p>On the drive from the airport after they picked me up, I only knew some basic nouns. After it got uncomfortably silent (because neither of us knew the other’s language), I started to point at things out the window and naming them in Italian, like ‘tree’ or ‘man.’ They caught on and started teaching me new words like ‘ocean’ and ‘car.’ Another time, I was expressing my confusion over the pronunciation of some phonemes and asked if they could help. From the back of a closet they produced some children’s books with accompanying cassettes. For the next few days, I listened and read along to children’s fables in Italian. Eventually, given their immense support, I could have full conversations with them, which was more entertaining than just saying nouns. </p>'+
							        '<p>I also made some great friends on the trip & went with them on class-sponsored ‘education trips’ to different places around Italy. One weekend, we went to Austria and stumbled upon the official Austria IronMan competition. I also became good friends with a woman who worked at my favorite ice cream shop. One of our first school assignments - let me remind you, I received Yale credit for this - was to approach a stranger and ask them their name and birthday, as that was what we had learned on our first day. Our friendship grew from there. I had a scoop of ‘foresta nera’ (‘black forest’ – chocolate ice cream with chunks of chocolate chunks and Maraschino cherries) basically daily. </p>'+
							        '<p>Overall, incredible time. I was happy, ate great food, enjoyed great company, and learned a new language – what more could you want!</p>'+

Two hours away from Córdoba, up in the mountains, lies <a href = https://caraya.org/>Argentina’s only monkey rehabilitation center</a>. The center’s primary purpose is to take in abandoned or domesticated monkeys and teach them how to survive in the wild, with the eventual goal of releasing them to a forest in Uruguay. </p>'+

							        '<p>This was my first time I travelled alone – and it was to another continent! I was 15 at the time and went to Spain for language classes in Salamanca and a week with a host family in San Sebastian. This was also my first time doing immersion language classes, which you can tell I loved because of how many other later times I went abroad to learn a language. And while I was only with my host family for a week, I learned a lot and enjoyed the experience. I even got to experience Spain’s healthcare system when I got sick halfway through!</p>'+

							        '<div id="bodyContent">'+
							        '<p>Three weeks before I flew to Rio de Janeiro, I decided I wanted to spend the spring of my gap year on a ship. I joined the students & crew of <b>Sørlandet</b>, a 210-foot long Norwegian tall ship and the oldest full-rigged ship still in operation, through the program <b>Class Afloat</b>, an international education program geared towards high school and gap year students. We travelled across the Atlantic Ocean (twice) to visit 12 countries/cities: Brazil, Gough Island, South Africa, Namibia, St. Helena, Ascension Island, Barbados, Trinidad & Tobago, Dominica, Guadeloupe, Bermuda, and Canada. </p>'+
							        '<p>Living on a ship was completely new. While we were at sea, I would work for 7 hours and be in class for 2. The hardest part to get used to, besides acquiring sea legs, was night watch. Two of those 7 work hours would be between 8pm and 8am. For example, if your watch (team) were scheduled on the 2-4 night watch, you would fall asleep at 10pm, wake up at 1:45an, be on watch from 2am-4am, be back in bed at 4:10am, and wake up again at 7am for breakfast. Everyone on board, myself included, got very good at falling asleep quickly. One of my good friends boasted that she could nap for five minutes: one to fall asleep, three asleep, and one to wake up. </p>'+
							        '<p>Yet however odd the schedules or on-board rules were, I saw things I would never see otherwise. The stars in the middle of the ocean are so clear that you can see a band of the galaxy. There were bioluminescent plankton that would light up in the ship’s wake. The sky and its sunsets look much bigger when there’s only water around you. I’m grateful not only for these experiences, but also getting to know 50 other travel-hungry people my age, many of whom I’ve met up with in other parts of the world since the program ended. </p>'+

							        '<p>This program was similar to my experience in Spain, except I stayed with a wonderful host family for the entire month instead of just one week. I really got along with the entire family and liked helping with their English school that they ran out of a room attached to their house. While I was there, I attended a quinceañera, went to the Iguazu falls with my (real) dad, and ate lots of dulce de leche.</p>'+
