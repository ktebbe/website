      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Since the winter wasn't providing consitant work I began to look for a more professional setting with more opportunities to learn new skills. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Nestled in Truckee surrounded by pine trees and chirping birds, I work with a team of 8 technicians responsible for maintaining over 200,000 square feet of high end private and fractional ownership cabins and townhomes.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>During my time with the company thus far, I have been able to learn many new skills while improving existing ones. Having  solid mechanical and electrical skills, I am able to appply them into diagnostics, service, and repair of many things. I really enjoy the logic puzzle involved with these repairs.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>My position as a maintenance technician allows me to combine many different skillsets in fun new ways. Communication, problem solving, conflict resolution, and good old fashioned tangible work all come together. </p>

        <p>After returning from Costa Rica I was looking to reintegrate myself here while continuing a fun adventurous lifestyle. So I got a position working in the rental department of Sugar Bowl </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The rental department was fun and challenging. I felt that my group managment and leadership skills carried directly over from my managment experience. It was enjoyable to be in a fast moving environment helping customers to have a good time. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately the winter was very dry and the lack of snow caused a shortage of work. I was forced to move on to something more sustainable and ended up at old greenwood. </p>

            <p>This was my first season with Corcovado Adventures tent camp. After the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiH85cqr1Fw" target="_blank">Rana Verde Ecolodge</a> was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUAoVplVi6g" target="_blank">burnt down</a> by corrupt police officials in <a href="http://bocasdeltoro.com/" target="_blank">Bocas Del Toro</a> I had to find a new opportunity. </p>

I had been to the Osa before as a tourist and fell in love with it. Its close proximity to the Panama border was also apealing. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.corcovado.com" target="_blank">Corcovado Adventures</a> was the first to invite me to volunteer with them. After one month of volunteering I was offered a management position which I accepted. Soon there after I was making changes and improvements while earning the respect of the local employees. <!-- END Timeline Unit Left -->

              July 2011 - Sept 2011</div>
              
              <p>Chasing a dream I updated my website and contacted people all around the world with the goal and intention of volunteering and learning to sail. After my time in Australia teaching diving and doing day charters to the Great Barrier Reef, I had a rekindled love for the sea. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Many opportunities had shown themselves but this was the first opportunity that I felt was a perfect match. After returning from Australia there were complications and unconsciously had slipped into my old way of life and realized I was not happy. Taking charge of my life and doing what I dreamed I bought a one way flight to Panama. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Although my experience was cut short by corruption and the burning of an Ecolodge, I made life long friends and some of the best memories of my life. I would love to share more about this, if you are interested just ask.</p>

              </div><p>After three plus years in Australia I returned home to California with my ex girlfriend. She was from another country and we had met in Australia. We had made plans to do more traveling together and getting rehired at Autowest Honda was supposed to be a short term thing. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>I had the intention of working for a few months, saving cash, and heading off on another adventure so I could spend time traveling with her. Things became complicated, our plans changed and I lost sight of my awareness and my intention. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The experience of again working for a corporation in conjunction with being personally &quot;lost&quot; caused me to re-evaluate the things I placed importance on and taught me to let go of ego and attachments. This was one of the most difficult years I have yet to experience, but it was also one of the most critical for me to continue on my path. </p>

              <p>Moving on from my experience in Bargara, I was excited to continue working on my diving career in a new location and even more excited to be lucky enough to do day charters to the Great Barrier Reef.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The retail location for 1770 Undersea Adventures doubled as a Tribal Travel store. This was a great and unexpected bonus. Working with tribal travel entailed selling tours and activities country wide to travelers from all over the world. This caused me to drastically improve my personal and business communication skills in a truly international setting. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The day charter aspect of the business was a very difficult one, but one that provided me with the biggest opportunities for personal growth. We also regularly performed safety and first aid drills. Thanks again to Don and James for giving me the chance to show my skills and gain some new ones. </p>

              <p>During a trip traveling through Central America I had met two other travelers who told me about working and traveling in Australia. This was right around the time of my first snorkeling experience in tropical waters. Arriving to Bargara was the manifestation of created dream. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>After returning home from a short vacation in Central America, tropical snorkeling and Australia still in my mind, I completed my Open Water dive course. During my first pool training,  my head went under water, and at that moment I knew I wanted to be the instructor. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Before I left to Australia I made arrangements to do my DiveMaster training with this dive shop. Soon after I started my training, the owner of the shop asked me to work with him. I worked as an assistant for a few months and after showing my skills he asked me to manage general operations. </p>

                <h3>Autowest Honda Roseville</h3>
                <a href="http://www.autonationhondaroseville.com" target="_blank">www.autonationhondaroseville.com </a>
              May 2002 - Oct 2008</div>
              
              <p>Autowest Honda was my first step out into the working world. I had a few part time jobs throughout highschool but I entered the automotive industry with a career in mind. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>I started at Autowest Honda towards the end of my senior year of highschool. I always had a mechanical and logical mind but previous to my senior year of highschool I didn't know how to even change oil. My autoshop teacher recommended me for an internship program. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>I accepted the internship and as part of the program I interviewed with many dealerships in the Roseville automall. Things went well and a couple of weeks later I was working at the dealership. As part of the internship I continued to go to school throughout the summer(after graduation). </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>I felt like the schooling was redundant and I was learning much more by being on the job. I spoke with my service manager at the time and was hired as a normal employee. It took me three years to reach journeyman level. I am grateful for everything I learned and the experiences I had at this dealership, but after 6 plus years I felt I hit a peak. There was nothing left to learn or do, I began to feel like I needed to make changes, and did.</p>

      <p>My automotive interests were started when I took autoshop in highschool. After entering the industry and working with Autowest Honda I went through extensive training and gained valuable experience. After my time with Honda I tried working for an independent and gained experience with other import model vehicles. The mechanical skills I gained during this time can be applied to so many different situations.      </p>

    <p>Now days we have a large variety of powerful software available to us depending on our needs. Starting when I was 13 (1997) I began to learn how to use different software tools. I designed and built my first website at this age and continued to further my education as I grew. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>While my education is not formal, I have learned many different technologies, softwares, and how to use them effectively and efficiently. Much of my knowledge is thanks to tutorials on <a href="http://www.lynda.com" target="_blank">Lynda.com,</a> simply using search engines to answer questions, and putting in the time to learn. I love learning but do not like the structure of &quot;school&quot;.</p>
