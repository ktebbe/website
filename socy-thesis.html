										<h2>“It’s Not My Place”: Relational Barriers, the Role of Peers, and the (Under)Reporting of Collegiate Sexual Misconduct</a></h2>

											<h3>Abstract</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Collegiate sexual misconduct is an alarming crisis not only for its high victimization rates but also for its persistent underutilization of formal resources. Sexual misconduct has the second- highest underreporting rate of any crime, with 65% of incidents going unreported and over 75% of collegiate misconduct victims not using any on-campus resources. Previous studies on underutilization too narrowly focus on just the victim’s experience and barriers to using these resources. The social context surrounding incidents of sexual misconduct complicates the understanding of this underutilization since the majority of sexual misconduct victims disclose their experience to a friend. However, current discussion regarding the community’s role in sexual misconduct is limited to prevention and not response.
										</p>
										<p>
											This study fills this void by investigating the reasons why those who learn about someone else’s instance of sexual misconduct do or do not take effort in involving formal resources. To perform this investigation, 39 Yale College seniors were interviewed on the one or more times they had heard about someone else’s uncomfortable sexual encounter, resulting in 88 total stories. For each story, the subject was asked about their relations to the others involved in the incident, their reactions, and how much effort they put into involving formal resources.
										</p>
										<p>
											An inductive analysis of the interviews finds different barriers for different relational configurations between the subject, victim, and perpetrator, with overarching themes such as a lack of personal responsibility, a preference towards informal action, and a fear of causing more harm to the victims. Subjects that do not know the victim take no effort to involve formal action, while those who do know the victim often try to avoid additional stress for the victim, which leads subjects away from formal resources. Additionally, these findings are corroborated by representative 2015 Yale sexual misconduct survey results, which speak to similar topics. Relevant policy implications and recommendations are presented in response to these relational-specific barriers, such as educational programs on the positive experience of those who use formal resources and more awareness of the policies available for reporting someone else’s instance of misconduct.
