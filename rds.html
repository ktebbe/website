										<h3>A free, online tool for sociologists to analyze their own respondent-driven sampling (RDS) data.</h3>
									</p>
									<p>
										Respondent-driven sampling is a sampling technique employed by researchers who seek to recruit hard-to-find or stigmatized populations. RDS works through a dual-incentive system that rewards a participant both for coming in herself and for recruiting another qualified participant who partakes in the study. After identifying some initial members of the target population, the researcher gives each participant a number of coupons with their unique serial number for them to give out to other members of the target population that he or she may know. The unique serial number is used to link recruiter and recruitee to make a network of participants. It is a similar technique to snowball sampling, but differs in the amount of identifying information (e.g. name, contact information) that the participant has to give to the researcher. This is useful in stigmatized populations, such as drug users, who may be hesitant to give up the information of other drug users they may know for fear of that information being given to law enforcement officials. For more information on the details of RDS, <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250988/">see here </a>. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Unfortunately, the existing analysis tools for RDS data are hard-to-use and often require the user to install certain software. During the summer of 2014, I created an application with Shiny, R’s web application framework. The application allows the user to upload their own data without any installations, downloads, or knowledge of how to program. Each components, such as mapping or network visualization, is customizable to the users wants and needs.
