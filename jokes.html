											<h3>Abstract</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											E-cigarette use, or “vaping,” is rapidly increasing in popularity, especially among adolescents. Studies show that most people find out about e-cigarettes through online sources or word of mouth. As such, public health agencies are interested in examining the nature of online conversations regarding e-cigarettes, especially analyzing what content is most salient to the audience.  
										</p>
										<p>
											To study these topics, streaming tweets were pulled from the Twitter Firehose from November 2014 to June 2016. Tweets were collected if they matched any word in a keyword list, chosen to encompass the many ways that individuals and organizations discuss e-cigarettes. Using the number of retweets as a proxy of salience, we found that many of the most popular e-cigarette tweets are jokes, including 15 of the top 20 most popular tweets. To study these jokes in more detail, our analysis focused on the text-based “we get it, you vape” trend, which originated from a user who received over 18,000 retweets on one of her tweets despite only having 7,000 followers. Many jokes accounts, who copied this user’s tweet within hours of its posting, helped contribute to the joke’s viral spread. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Further analysis revealed how users organically joke about real-life events, including song releases and football games, and documented that many hyper-popular tweets come from users with relatively few followers. These findings highlight the prevalence of jokes in online e-cigarette discussions and stress the importance for further research, such as studying the implications these jokes have on their audience’s opinions and use of e-cigarettes.

											<h3>Project Context</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											During the summer of 2016, I analyzed the role of e-cigarette (“vape”) jokes on Twitter and their potential impacts on online public health campaigns. I worked independently on my project among a team that used the same corpus of vape-related tweets. I had to use alternative analysis methods as jokes are exceedingly difficult to categorize, since they are highly contextual and often hard to understand outside of the community in which they are created. Outside of manual classification of the most highly retweeted tweets, I worked with a subset of the data that belonged to a text-based joke trend – “we get it, you vape.” From then, my goals were to understand the type of user that created and disseminated this content. Doing so required many types of investigations, including the presence of “social bots,” the relationship between a user’s number of followers and their number of retweets, and connections between heightened posting activity and the corresponding offline events. I predominantly used graphical exploration of the data to probe these trends and communicate findings.
